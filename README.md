# React-Google-Books-App ðŸ“š

 <br>



#### This is a book application. We see the books in the project through an API. When a word about the desired book is typed in the search section, we can access all the books in that word. Authors, publication dates, fees and descriptions of the books are also available. This project was completed using CSS, Tailwind, and React.js and my purpose in making this project was to experience basic React.js features. The project was made as a responsive design.<br> <br> <br>

My achievements were:
- Master layout creation
- CSS
- Tailwind
- React hooks
- Regular Expression
- Responsive Design
- API
